    <h3>Announcements</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>October 18, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            This is a reminder that installing uBlock Protector List is not optional, installation instructions can
            be found on my <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">home page</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>September 19, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            uBlock Protector is <strong>100% free</strong>, and I do <strong>not</strong> accept donation.
            <strong>Now and in the future.</strong> My GitHub ID is <code>jspenguin2017</code>, my GitLab ID is
            <code>xuhaiyang1234</code>, and my domain is <code>jspenguin.com</code>. Be careful to not get scammed
            by someone who is pretending to be a developer of uBlock Protector.
        </p>

        <h4>September 4, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            My classes are starting tomorrow so I will have much less time maintaining this project from now on.
            I still want to prioritize quality over quantity. I will test every solution before adding them to
            this project just like before. Issues will probably take much longer to resolve as a result, but
            I will be there eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need my attention as soon as possible, prepend the title of your issue with <code>URGENT! </code>,
            I will try to respond within 2 days. However, you must have a good reason for marking your issue as urgent.
            One good reason is if uBlock Protector is causing further breakage.
        </p>

        <h4>August 6, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            Since Flash player will be completely removed in 2020, websites that have anti-adblock after requesting
            Flash support are now low priority.
        </p>

        <h4>July 24, 2017</h4>
        <p>
            I am aware that this page is a lot wider than it should on high DPI devices, it is caused by a bug in
            Chromium / Chrome and is fixed in Chromium / Chrome 61.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Is uBlock Protector List installed and enabled in uBlock Origin?
            <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/" target="_blank">How do I do that?</a>
        </p>
        <p>Is uBlock Protector (both List and Extension) up to date?</p>
        <p>Are you using another filter list that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Are you using another extension that may cause conflicts?</p>
        <p>Did you change uBlock Origin settings that may cause it to misbehave?</p>
        <p>
            Are you using Anti-Adblock Killer, AAK-Cont, or uBO-Extra? uBlock Protector does similar things as they do
            which can lead to conflicts.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>Common Questions and Problems</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Will there be a configurable white list?</h4>
        <p>
            Not until I have a reliable way to synchronously send configuration data to content scripts. This is a limitation
            of Chromium / Chrome.
        </p>

        <h4>uBlock Protector is causing (further) breakage.</h4>
        <p>
            Report it and I will try to take care of it within 2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to breakage
            <strong>caused</strong> by uBlock Protector, other breakages may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>

        <h4>A website freezes with uBlock Protector enabled.</h4>
        <p>
            Some websites will intentionally freeze (with an infinite loop for example) once they detect uBlock Protector,
            it could also be caused by a bug in uBlock Protector, either way, report it and I will try to take care of it within
            2 days. Keep in mind that this only apply to freezings <strong>caused</strong> by uBlock Protector, other freezings
            may not be fixed this fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use task manager to terminate the tab that froze, go to <code>Menu -&gt; More tools -&gt; Task manager</code>,
            select the tab that froze, then click <code>End process</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>A website is still detecting uBlock Origin.</h4>
        <p>
            uBlock Protector is not magical, a lot of websites need to be fixed on a case by case basis. Report it and I will have a look.
            Depending on the website, it can take some time.
        </p>

        <h4>I loaded this extension in a browser that is not Chromium / Chrome and it works.</h4>
        <p>
            I am aware that this extension runs in more than just Chromium / Chrome, but I am not willing to spend time testing and
            fixing issues specific to other browsers. Therefore, you must test to make sure issues you encounter are reproducible on
            Chromium / Chrome before reporting them.
        </p>
        <p>I will only publish this extension to Web Store.</p>

        <h4>A website is perceptibly slower with uBlock Protector enabled.</h4>
        <p>Report it and I will have a look.</p>
    </div>

            Their Proof of Work Captcha is not bypassable, I will not add a white list as they start the mining process as soon as the page loads. The
            control is in your hand, white list the page if you absolutely need the resource locked behind the Captcha.
        </p>
        <p>I will be fixing websites that only ask for Proof of Work when it detects uBlock Origin, but I cannot fix those that ask for it unconditionally.</p>

            After months of intense cat and mouse game, I have decided to give up. This is unfortunate but this is the only way to go. I highly recommend
            you to stop visiting these websites. If that is not an option, you can load uBlock Protector Extension in debug mode to activate proprietary
            solutions. Click
            <a href="https://github.com/jspenguin2017/uBlockProtector/blob/master/Extension%20Compiler/Extension/content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js" target="_blank">here</a>
            to learn more, make sure to read and understand all the instructions.
        </p>
        <p>The code for loading these proprietary solutions are not uploaded to the Web Store.</p>

    <h3>For Developers</h3>
    <div>
        <p>You need to edit and load the unpacked extension if you want to enable debug mode or to change rules.</p>
        <p>
            Debug switch is in <code>common.js</code>. It may be already on when you pull the repository. Be aware that proprietary code loaders
            located in <code>content/3-content-rules-4-proprietary.js</code> may run when the extension is loaded in debug mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Documentation of my custom API is in <code>content/content-core.js</code>, <code>content/content-domlib.js</code>, and
            <code>background/background-core.js</code>. <code>$</code> is not jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>Rules are in <code>content/3-content-rules-*.js</code> and <code>background/background-rules.js</code>.</p>
        <p>
            Some rules that will help with debugging, along with rules that are work in progress, are in <code>content/content-debug.js</code>
            and <code>background/background-debug.js</code>. They will only run in debug mode.
